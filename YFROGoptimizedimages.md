# Getting optimized images #
If your application need to display an image hosted at yfrog.com you can get version of the image, optimized for your device. You need to add ":" and then device type to your URL.
## For example: ##

For yfrog URL
```
http://yfrog.com/0fh5rvw4j
```

Direct image URL, optimized for iPhone would be:
```
http://yfrog.com/0fh5rvw4j:iphone
```

Currently only **"iPhone"** device type is supported, which will return the image, scaled to fit **480x480** box.
