# Getting the Thumbnail for a Photo or a Video #
You can get thumbnails for any image or video posted via yfrog.com. To get an URL for thumbnail just add **":small"** prefix to the yfrog URL.<br />
## For example: ##
For the yfrog URL
```
http://yfrog.com/0fh5rvw4j
```

the corresponding thumbnail URL is
```
http://yfrog.com/0fh5rvw4j:small
```

**NOTE:** The use of **".th.jpg"** suffix to the URL is deprecated. We strongly recommend replacing with the **":small"** option.
